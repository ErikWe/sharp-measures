# The SharpMeasures Source Generator

> The actual API is currently only documented through XML documentation on the actual C# types. To get started with the generator, a good place to start might be the definitions in SharpMeasures, found [here](https://github.com/ErikWe/sharp-measures/tree/main/SharpMeasures/SharpMeasures).
